# Debugging with VS Code Workshop

Are you still debugging your code with print statements and commenting out chunks of code? Would you like a more efficient way to observe and test your programs? Then you should consider incorporating Visual Studio Code’s (VS Code) built-in debugger!  

In this workshop we will cover how to use the VS Code debugger for testing a software program at run time. You will learn how to pause a running program at key locations in your code (breakpoints) and observe and/or update your project’s variables. To follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, you will need to bring a personal laptop computer. You will also need to either have VS Code installed on your laptop computer or have a Research Computing account so that you can use VS Code through OnDemand. You can register for a Research Computing account beforehand (this will take about 10 minutes). 

This folder contains the workshop's powerpoint, pdf handout, and example program.
